# Mini E-commerce Product & Cart

This project is a small e-commerce UI built using **React** to demonstrate core frontend concepts like component design, state management, and clean code structure.

The focus of this project is correctness, clarity, and good React practices rather than adding unnecessary features or UI libraries.
